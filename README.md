## Project Overview

This project focuses on **improving short-term electricity demand forecasting** in **local energy communities** through the application of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques.  
It compares several predictive approaches — **ARIMA**, **Random Forest**, **LSTM**, **TCN**, and **Transfer Learning** — using **time series data of energy consumption** enriched with **temporal, meteorological, and community-related variables**.  

The goal is to develop models capable of achieving **greater forecasting accuracy and adaptability**, supporting the **efficient and data-driven management** of local energy systems.

## Objectives

The project aims to **improve energy demand forecasting** in local energy communities by:  
1. Identifying **key environmental and behavioral variables** that enrich prediction models.  
2. Comparing **traditional methods** (ARIMA, Random Forest) with **advanced neural architectures** (LSTM, TCN).  
3. Evaluating the **transferability of trained models** between different communities to enhance scalability and adaptability.
